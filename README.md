*If you're On-time, you're late, and if you're late, you never should have come in the first place.*

In short, __never__ be late.

  <h3>
    My Favorite Classes and Why
  </h3>
  
  | Class | Reason why it is among my favorites |
  |:---|:---:|
  | Computer Science | Even though it seems like I'm trying to suck up for some brownie points, I genuinely enjoy programming. |
  | Politics | If I could bring popcorn to this class to watch some arguments go down I would in a heartbeat. |
  | Spanish 4 | It's an easy class, there's not much more than that | 
  | Honorable Mention: The Bus | A whole two hours of my day are spent on four different busses, one of which has no AC and I take it twice a day |
